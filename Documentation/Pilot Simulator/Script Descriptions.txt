straight_and_level: 
Start at and maintain 10k ft, 240 kts, 90 deg heading

straight_and_level_accelerate: 
Start at and maintain 10k ft, 90 deg heading. 
Start at 240 kts and accelerate to 300 kts when t=15s.

straight_and_climb: 
Start at and maintain 240 kts, 90 degree heading. 
Start at 10k ft and climb to 15k ft when t=15 seconds.

straight_and_descend: 
Start at and maintain 240 kts, 90 degree heading. 
Start at 15k ft and descend to 10k ft when t=15 seconds.

level_turns: 
Start at and maintain 240 kts, 10k ft. 
Start at 90 degree heading and turn to 180 degree heading at t=15 seconds. 
Turn to 90 degree heading once 180 degree heading is reached.

climb_and_turn: 
Start at and maintain 240 kts. 
Start at 10k ft and climb to 15k ft at t=15 seconds. 
Start at 90 degree heading and turn to 180 degree heading at t=15 seconds.

descend_and_turn: 
Start at and maintain 240 kts. 
Start at 15k ft and descend to 10k ft at t=15 seconds. 
Start at 180 degree heading and turn to 90 degree heading at t=15 seconds.

holding_pattern: 
Start at and maintain 10k ft, 240 kts. Start at heading of 90 degrees.
Hold heading 90 for 60 seconds, then begin a 180 degree turn to a heading of 270 degrees, turning 
towards the pilot's right. 
Fly heading 270 for 60 seconds, then perform a 180 degree turn to a 
heading of 90 degrees, again turning towards the pilot's right. 
Repeat indefinitely.
Standard turn rate in large aircraft like the B737 is (quite a bit) lower than 3 deg/s.

takeoff: 
Begin at rest on ground (runway) with a 90 degree heading, elevator mode off, 
ailerons in heading mode holding 90 degrees, throttle in percent mode at 0 percent.
Begin with flap-cmd-norm to 0.375 (setting"5"; ~14 degrees), brake-left-cmd and brake-right-cmd set to 0. 
At t=15 seconds, set throttle percent to 0.5. When both engine n1 values exceed 40, set throttle
percent to 0.95 (this corresponds to n1 of 100).
When airspeed is above 150 kts, set elevator controller to pitch mode, targeting 10 degrees pitch. 
Once airspeed exceeds 170 kts and altitude exceeds 50 ft, retract landing gear and
set elevators to airspeed mode so that pitch is adjusted to hold airspeed at 170 kts.
When altitude exceeds 1000 ft, measure vertical speed and set elevator to vert_speed mode,
targeting half of measured vertical speed, and
put throttle controller into airspeed mode with reference airspeed of 250 kts.
Set flap-cmd-norm to 0.125 (setting "1"; ~8 degrees) when airspeed exceeds 190 kts. 
Set flap-cmd-norm to 0 when airspeed exceeds 210 kts.
When altitude exceeds 10k ft, set reference airspeed to 280 kts and reference altitude to desired cruising altitude.

landing:
Begin at and hold 3000 ft, heading hold 90, airspeed hold 200 kts.
Begin with flap-cmd-norm to 0.375 (setting "5").
Begin with gear down.
Set target airspeed to 160 kts.
When airspeed is lower than 170 kts, set flap-cmd-norm to 0.5 (setting
"10").
When airspeed is lower than 150 kts, set flap-cmd-norm to 0.625 (setting
"15").
Set elevator controller to vertical speed mode, seeking -11.67 fps (-700
fpm; approx. 3 degree glideslope).
Set target airspeed to 137 kts.
When airspeed is lower than 140 kts, set flap-cmd-norm to 0.875
(setting "30").
Maintain speed and glideslope until altitude is less than 100 ft.

takeoff_stall: 
Same as takeoff script, except that at t=100 seconds,
set elevator controller to pitch mode, targeting pitch of 85 degrees.
